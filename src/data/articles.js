    content: `The Boca Beach Boys picked up a convincing 10-4 road victory over the Iguanas on Friday morning at Keiser University, improving their 2026 SFCBL record with a balanced effort on both sides of the ball.

## Roby McClarnon: Player of the Game

Roby McClarnon was the offensive star of the afternoon, going 2-for-4 with a home run and three RBIs. His big fly provided the kind of momentum swing that put the game firmly out of reach.

## Aiden Rivero Shuts Down Iguanas Early

On the mound, starting pitcher Aiden Rivero was dominant through his three innings of work. He allowed just one hit, struck out three, and didn't surrender an earned run — setting the tone for what became a comfortable Beach Boys win.

## Up Next

The Beach Boys are back in action tomorrow as the summer schedule heats up. Stay tuned to DP.Broadcast for all the coverage.`,
